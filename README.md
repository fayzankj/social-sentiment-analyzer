# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Posts
This project aims to develop a robust sentiment analysis tool that classifies the emotional tone of social media posts, specifically tweets, as either **positive** or **negative**. By leveraging the **Sentiment 140** dataset, this tool provides valuable insights into public sentiment, trends, and opinions expressed across Twitter.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

### **Data Collection:**
- Seamlessly integrates the **Kaggle API** to download the **Sentiment 140 dataset**, which contains over **1.6 million labeled tweets**.
  
### **Data Preprocessing:**
- Cleans and prepares the raw text data by performing the following:
  - **Converting text to lowercase** for uniformity.
  - **Removing non-alphabetic characters** to retain meaningful content.
  - **Tokenizing and stemming** using **NLTK's PorterStemmer** to extract core meanings.
  - **Filtering out stopwords**, reducing noise and enhancing model efficiency.

### **Machine Learning Model:**
- Converts preprocessed text into **numerical vectors** using **TF-IDF vectorization**, capturing important keywords and context.
- Employs **Logistic Regression** for sentiment classification, distinguishing between **positive** and **negative** sentiments in tweets.

### **Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluates model performance using **accuracy metrics** on both training and testing datasets.
- Visualizes performance comparison between training and testing accuracy, offering intuitive insights into the model‚Äôs effectiveness.

### **Persistent Model:**
- Saves the trained model using **pickle**, making it easy for future use or deployment without needing to retrain.

### **Dataset Management:**
- Automates dataset download, extraction, and preparation processes, ensuring a smooth workflow and reducing manual intervention.
- Handles **missing values** and **renames columns** for consistency across datasets.

## üìä Dataset Details

The **Sentiment 140 dataset** contains **1.6 million tweets** that are pre-labeled as either:

- **0** (Negative sentiment)
- **1** (Positive sentiment)

You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140).

## üìà Performance Metrics

- **Training Accuracy:** 81%
- **Testing Accuracy:** 78%

These results demonstrate the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data, with solid performance on both training and testing datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Libraries

This project utilizes a range of powerful Python libraries to process data, build the model, and evaluate performance:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing, including tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing model performance and results.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.

## üìù Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-social-media.git
```
### 2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Set up your Kaggle API token:
- Download your kaggle.json API token from Kaggle.
- Place the kaggle.json file in the project folder to enable dataset downloading.

### 4. Model Usage  
The trained Logistic Regression model is saved and ready for use. You can easily load the model and classify the sentiment of new tweets using the predict_sentiment function.
```bash
sentiment = predict_sentiment("I love this new product!")
print("Sentiment:", "Positive" if sentiment == 1 else "Negative")
```
